// Package evtm manages the scheduling and execution of events.

// This logic is built around the EventManager data structure.
// It uses an evtq.EventQueue data structure to hold events, which itself
// uses the vrtime module's Time data structure to hold the values ordered by the EventQueue.
//
//	In addition to the usual functionality one expects from an event list,
//	- the EventManager has an option of running in 'wallclock' time, which ties
//	  the advancement of virtual time to be the same rate (in real-time) as physical time
//	  as might be seen on the clock on a wall.  This feature has particular utility when
//	  the simulation model integrates real devices that participate in the model execution,
//	  but are not controlled by the EventManager.
//	- access to critial data elements are guarded by mutex's, to enable use in a multi-threaded context
//	- all functions whose executions are triggered by the execution of an event have a particular
//	  function type declared.  With respect to what Go allows with function types, this one is simple and easy to use.
//	  The interface specifies the 'context' for the event, through provisioning of a pointer to some struct representing
//	  an entity in the model, and provisioning of some 'data' the event handler views as being presented to the event
//	  handler for application at that position in the model.
//	- there is user-selectable operating mode where if the event list goes empty the thread running the EventManager
//	  suspends;  the action of (some other thread) scheduling an event reactivates it.  This turns out to be needed
//	  when simulation is mixed with emulation, the emulation thread is running and needs to complete and possibly
//	  cause the scheduling of an event.
//
// To use the EventManager the simulation experiment code first builds the data structures of a model,
// and schedules one or more events whose execution starts the model execution.  In general, the execution of an event function
// will involve the scheduling of subsequent events (and their event handlers) to propagate forward the consequences of that
// event execution.
//
//	The process of executing an event is to (a) identify the event in the EventQueue with least Time value, (b) set the
//
// virtual time of the EventManager to be that value, and (c) call the event handler listed in the event,
// including as call parameters the context and data stored in the event.
//
// After an initial set of events are scheduled, one starts the simulation by calling the EventManager function method
// Run(LimitTime float64). Control is returned from this when the least time event in the EventQueue has a time that
// is strictly larger than LimitTime, or when there are no further events to process in the EventQueue.
// In the former case the clock of the EventManager is advanced to LimitTime even though no event necessarily took
// place at that time, in the latter case the EventManager time is left at the time of the least event executed.
// This design decision makes it possible for one to run the simulation, window of simulation time by window of simulation time,
// after a window completes loading the event list with events to execute in the next window without needing to dither around with
// the EventManager clock value.  Certain parallel simulation time management
// protocols work this way, and the design is meant to support that.
